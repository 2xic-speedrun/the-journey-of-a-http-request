## DNS
Specification of the message format is explained here https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt, http://www-inf.int-evry.fr/~hennequi/CoursDNS/NOTES-COURS_eng/msg.html and https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/dns/appa_02.htm

Parameters are better described here https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml

## HTTP
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol is actually quite good.

Http 1/1 is simple, and a basic poc is implemented .

Maybe I should do http/2 ? Will attempt some other projects first, I think. Mainly did this to understand the basics of DNS message protocols.

## HTTPs ? 
Maybe
